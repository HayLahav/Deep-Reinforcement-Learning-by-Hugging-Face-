# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-by-Hugging-Face-

* The Deep RL course by Hugging Face is a free, open-source course that teaches about Deep RL from beginner to expert. The course is divided into four units:
    * Unit 1: Introduction to Deep RL
    * Unit 2: Introduction to Q-Learning
    * Unit 3: Deep Q-Learning with Atari Games
    * Unit 4: Advanced Deep RL Topics
* In Unit 1, learners will learn the foundations of Deep RL, including the Markov decision process, the Bellman equation, and value-based and policy-based RL algorithms.
* In Unit 2, learners will learn about Q-Learning, a value-based RL algorithm that is used to learn optimal policies for Markov decision processes.
* In Unit 3, learners will apply Q-Learning to train an agent to play Atari games.
* In Unit 4, learners will learn about advanced Deep RL topics, such as deep Q-networks, policy gradients, and actor-critic methods.
* The course also includes a number of bonus units, such as an introduction to Deep RL with Huggy, a reinforcement learning agent that is built on top of Hugging Face's Transformers library.
* The Deep RL course by Hugging Face is a comprehensive and well-structured resource for learning about Deep RL. The course is taught by experienced practitioners in the field, and it covers a wide range of topics. If learners are interested in learning about Deep RL, I highly recommend this course.
